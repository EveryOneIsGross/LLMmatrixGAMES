# LLMmatrixGAMES - LLM Matrix Game Framework

Inspired by the application of 'serious' games. Matrix Games offer a compelling framework for multi-agent antagonistic knowledge exploration. 

## Components

1. Two opposing LLMs (LLM-A and LLM-B)
2. Neutral Adjudicator LLM (NA-LLM)
3. Domain-specific knowledge base
4. Scoring mechanism
5. State tracker

## LLM States

Each LLM (including the Adjudicator) can be in one of three states:
1. **Proposing**: Generating actions or arguments
2. **Responding**: Countering proposals or providing rebuttals
3. **Evaluating**: Assessing arguments and updating game state (primarily for NA-LLM)

## Enhanced Game Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Load domain-specific knowledge into all LLMs
   - Set game objectives for LLM-A and LLM-B
   - Initialize scoring system and state tracker

2. **Round Structure**
   a. Proposal Phase
      - LLM-A (Proposing state): Proposes an action
      - LLM-A: Provides 3 justification statements

   b. Response Phase
      - LLM-B (Responding state): Provides 3 counter-arguments

   c. Rebuttal Phase
      - LLM-A (Responding state): Offers 2 rebuttals to counter-arguments

   d. Adjudication Phase
      - NA-LLM (Evaluating state): Analyzes all arguments
      - Assigns weights and calculates total modifier
      - Determines action success/failure
      - Updates game state and scores

   e. Role Switch
      - LLM-A and LLM-B switch roles for the next round

3. **Game Conclusion**
   - Game ends when a predefined condition is met (e.g., score threshold, number of rounds)
   - Final analysis and outcome determination by NA-LLM

## Scoring Mechanism

- Base points for successful actions
- Bonus points for compelling arguments (as judged by NA-LLM)
- Penalty points for logical fallacies or irrelevant arguments
- Cumulative score tracked throughout the game

## State Tracker

- Maintains current game state, including:
  - Round number
  - Current scores
  - History of actions and arguments
  - Any scenario-specific variables (e.g., resources, positions)

## Abstraction for Different Scenarios

1. **Debate Simulation**
   - Actions become main arguments
   - Justifications are supporting points
   - Counter-arguments are rebuttals
   - NA-LLM acts as a debate judge

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Actions are proposed solutions
   - Justifications are benefits of the solution
   - Counter-arguments are potential drawbacks
   - NA-LLM evaluates overall effectiveness and fairness

3. **Scientific Reasoning**
   - Actions are hypotheses
   - Justifications are supporting evidence and reasoning
   - Counter-arguments are alternative explanations or conflicting evidence
   - NA-LLM evaluates based on scientific merit and methodology

4. **Business Strategy**
   - Actions are strategic decisions
   - Justifications are projected benefits and alignment with goals
   - Counter-arguments are risks and potential negative outcomes
   - NA-LLM evaluates based on projected ROI and alignment with company values

5. **Ethical Dilemma Analysis**
   - Actions are potential decisions in an ethical dilemma
   - Justifications are ethical principles supporting the decision
   - Counter-arguments are opposing ethical considerations
   - NA-LLM evaluates based on overall ethical impact and adherence to moral frameworks

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully design prompts for each LLM state to ensure appropriate responses.

2. **Knowledge Base Management**: Regularly update and curate the domain-specific knowledge base to keep scenarios relevant and accurate.

3. **Bias Mitigation**: Implement checks and balances to minimize potential biases in the NA-LLM's adjudication process.

4. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle varying complexity levels, from simple debates to multi-faceted conflict scenarios.

5. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate a mechanism to learn from past games, improving LLM performance and scenario design over time.

6. **User Interface**: Develop an intuitive interface for human oversight, allowing for real-time adjustments and analysis.

7. **Extensibility**: Create a modular design that allows for easy addition of new scenarios or modification of existing ones.

## Thoughts

- The resulting dataset can be used to constrain future frameworks without the need for a Adjudicator, creating a baynesian bound to the potential think-space.
