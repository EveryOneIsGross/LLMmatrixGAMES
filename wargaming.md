## Wargaming: The Resurgence of Games as Tools for Decision-Making and Analysis

[Youtube Doco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k)

This document explores the resurgence of wargaming, the practice of using games to simulate and analyze real-world scenarios, particularly within the military, government, and related sectors. It delves into the history, mechanics, and ethical considerations surrounding this practice, with a particular focus on its growing influence on the commercial games industry and the potential implications for game developers and players.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Wargaming:**  The use of games (tabletop, video, role-playing, etc.) to simulate real-world scenarios, analyze potential outcomes, and train decision-makers, particularly in military and government contexts.
* **Influence Warfare:** A modern form of conflict involving manipulation, disinformation, and psychological tactics to achieve political and strategic goals without engaging in physical combat.
* **Matrix Games:** Tabletop role-playing-like games where teams representing different actors compete by describing actions and providing justifications, with a neutral adjudicator determining outcomes based on predetermined rules and dice rolls.
* **Mega Games:** Large-scale, immersive games often involving dozens or hundreds of players simulating complex political, military, or social scenarios in a dynamic and interactive environment.
* **Serious Games:** Wargames adapted for non-military contexts such as healthcare, logistics, disaster response, and policy development, aiming to improve efficiency, preparedness, and decision-making.
* **Ethics of Wargaming:** The moral implications of using game design for military purposes, including the potential for unintended consequences, the normalization of violence, and the responsibility of game developers in contributing to such applications.
* **Military-Commercial Games Industry Crossover:** The increasingly blurred lines between wargaming and the commercial games industry, including the use of commercial games for military training, the influence of wargaming on game design, and the potential for recruitment and talent acquisition by the military from the commercial sector.

**Game Mechanics Mentioned:**

* **Hex and Counter Wargames:** Traditional tabletop games using hexagonal grids and counters to represent units and terrain, often used for simulating military battles and campaigns.
* **Miniature Wargames:** Games using miniature figures and terrain to simulate battles and scenarios, providing a visual and tactile representation of conflict.
* **Matrix Game Mechanics:** Actions, justifications, adjudicator rulings, dice rolls, modifiers, and resource management elements to simulate complex interactions and decision-making processes.
* **Mega Game Mechanics:** Large-scale player interaction, role-playing, negotiation, resource management, and dynamic scenario evolution to create immersive and realistic simulations.
* **Video Game Simulations:** Realistic modeling of military hardware, tactics, and environments, including advanced physics engines, artificial intelligence, and network capabilities for training and analysis.

**Summary:**

The document argues that wargaming is experiencing a resurgence driven by factors such as global instability, technological advancements, and a generation of gamers entering decision-making roles. It examines the diverse forms of modern wargames, from traditional tabletop exercises to sophisticated computer simulations, highlighting the increasing overlap between government wargaming and the commercial games industry. 

The ethical implications of this crossover are explored in detail, questioning whether turning play into a tool for military planning and potentially lethal decision-making is justifiable. Concerns are raised about the potential for unintended consequences, the normalization of violence, and the responsibility of game developers who contribute to such applications.

The document also presents the counter-argument that wargaming can be a valuable tool for positive social impact, particularly when adapted for "serious games" in non-military contexts. However, it acknowledges concerns about the effectiveness and potential biases inherent in wargaming, emphasizing the need for transparency, data sharing, and rigorous evaluation to ensure the validity and reliability of insights derived from these simulations. 

Furthermore, the document highlights the challenges of evaluating the effectiveness of wargaming due to the military's tendency towards secrecy and the limited availability of data on past wargames and their outcomes. 

Ultimately, the document urges the games industry to acknowledge and engage with the resurgence of wargaming, recognizing its potential opportunities and responsibilities in shaping the future of this practice. It calls for dialogue and action, suggesting that the industry's expertise and influence could be used to promote ethical development, ensure transparency, advocate for the demilitarization of the sector where appropriate, and contribute to the responsible application of wargaming for the benefit of society.

**In essence, the document serves as a wake-up call for the games industry, urging it to confront the complex and often uncomfortable relationship between play, simulation, and the potential for both positive and negative real-world impact, particularly in the context of war and conflict.**
